A mod for controlling the chance of a villager turning into a zombie villager, regardless of the world's difficulty.

This mod is licensed under the [BSD 3-Clause license](./LICENSE). I use this license because it is short, easy to
understand, and quite permissive. I believe licenses that achieve these goals are best for the growth of the open source
community.
